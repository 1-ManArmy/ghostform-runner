```

### 2. Success Files (`SUCCESS_FOUND_*.json`)
```json
{
  "booking_id": "5871858498",

  "timestamp": "2025-07-21 03:11:06",
  "agent_id": "Agent-2",
  "attempt_number": 47
}
```

### 3. YAML PIN Management (Optional)

- **Progress bar** showing completion percentage
- **Interactive chart** showing attempt result distribution
- **Recent attempts** log with timestamps and results

## üîß Configuration

### Server Configuration
Edit `dashboard_server.py` to modify:
```python
# Files to monitor
LOG_FILE = "agent-log.txt"
SUCCESS_PREFIX = "SUCCESS_FOUND_"
YAML_PINS_FILE = "pins_master.yaml"
YAML_PROGRESS_FILE = "pins_progress.yaml"

# Server settings
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```

### Dashboard Customization
Edit `bosss_ai_playwright_dashboard.html` to modify:
- Auto-refresh interval (default: 30 seconds)
- Chart types and colors
- UI layout and styling
- Additional features and controls

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

The dashboard provides REST API endpoints:

### `/api/data` - Main Dashboard Data
```json
{
  "booking_data": {
    "5871858498": {
      "pins_tried": 47,
      "total_attempts": 52,
      "success_pin": "1985",
      "recent_attempts": [...],
      "success_rate": 8.5
    }
  },
  "combined_stats": {
    "total_pins_tried": 47,
    "total_attempts": 52,
    "agents_active": 3,
    "total_bookings": 1
  },
  "last_update": "2025-07-21 15:30:45"
}
```

### `/api/agents` - Agent Status
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "boss_ai_playwright_1A",
      "file": "boss_ai_playwright_1A.py",
      "active": true,
      "file_size": 15842
    }
  ]
}
```

### `/api/yaml_status` - YAML File Status
```json
{
  "pins_master_exists": true,
  "pins_progress_exists": true,
  "total_pins_in_master": 10000,
  "pins_allocated": 150,
  "pins_completed": 47
}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Start
1. Check Python installation: `python --version`
2. Install Flask: `pip install flask pyyaml`
3. Check port availability: `netstat -an | findstr :5000`
4. Run with debug: `python dashboard_server.py`

### No Data Showing
1. Verify `agent-log.txt` exists and has data
2. Check log file format matches expected CSV structure
3. Ensure agents are writing to the correct log file
4. Check file permissions

### Agents Not Showing as Active
1. Agents must write to log file within last 5 minutes
2. Check agent log format includes timestamp as first column
3. Verify agents are actually running and making attempts

### Browser Issues
1. Try different browser or incognito mode
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Check JavaScript console for errors
4. Ensure network connectivity to dashboard server

## üìà Performance Tips

### For Large Scale Operations (1000+ Agents)
1. **Enable log rotation** to prevent huge log files
2. **Use SSD storage** for faster file I/O
3. **Monitor RAM usage** during heavy operations
4. **Consider database storage** for very large datasets

### Dashboard Optimization
1. **Adjust auto-refresh interval** based on system load
2. **Limit recent attempts** display to last 10-15 entries
3. **Use browser performance tools** to monitor resource usage
4. **Close unused browser tabs** when running intensive operations

## üîí Security Notes

### Development vs Production
- **Current setup is for development** with debug mode enabled
- **For production use**, deploy with proper WSGI server (gunicorn, uwsgi)
- **Add authentication** for production environments
- **Use HTTPS** in production deployments

### Network Security
- **Dashboard runs on all interfaces** (0.0.0.0) for network access
- **Consider firewall rules** if exposing to network
- **Monitor access logs** for unauthorized access attempts

## üìû Support & Integration

### Integration with Agent System
The dashboard automatically detects and works with:
- All `boss_ai_playwright_*.py` agent files
- The `agent-log.txt` logging system
- Success files with `SUCCESS_FOUND_` prefix
- YAML PIN management files (when implemented)

### Future Enhancements
- **Database integration** for persistent storage
- **Email/SMS alerts** for successful PIN discoveries
- **Advanced analytics** and trend analysis
- **Multi-user support** with role-based access
- **Real-time WebSocket updates** for instant notifications
